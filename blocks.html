Spoken by about 96 million people (2022),[10] Telugu is the most widely spoken member of the Dravidian language family, and one of the twenty-two scheduled languages of the Republic of India.[11] It is one of the few languages that has primary official status in more than one Indian state, alongside Hindi and Bengali.[12] Telugu is one of the 11 languages designated as a classical language by the Government of India. It is the 14th most spoken native language in the world.[13] Modern Standard Telugu is based on the dialect of erstwhile Krishna, Guntur, East Godavari and West Godavari districts of Coastal Andhra.</blockquote>
